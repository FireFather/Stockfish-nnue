-Clang-tidy recommendations/fixes applied:
-Use auto when initializing with a cast to avoid duplicating the type name [modernize-use-auto]
-auto can be declared as 'auto *' [readability-qualified-auto]
-Use emplace_back instead of push_back [modernize-use-emplace]
-Parameter may be const
-Functional-style cast used instead of a C++ cast
-Local variable may be const
-Member function may be 'const'
-Member function may be 'static'
-C-style cast used instead of a C++ cast
-Functional-style cast used instead of a C++ cast
-Include guard not found at the beginning of a header file
-Possibly unused #include directive
-Redundant parentheses
-Zero constant can be replaced with nullptr
-Use range-based for loop instead [modernize-loop-convert]
-The 'empty' method should be used to check for emptiness instead of 'size' [readability-container-size-empty]
-Redundant declaration [readability-redundant-declaration]

Modernized from c++14 to c++17 & fully translated to English
